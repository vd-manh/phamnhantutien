"""A game character as the caster: the owner's own sprite sheets, read through a rig.json.

The effect is drawn in the character's frame space: the effect's pivot is the character's pivot (the feet), its
frame k plays with the character's frame `start + k` at the character's fps, and a top-down effect has one row per
direction of the character. The sheet stays the effect alone; the character goes into the previews only, and the
JSON tells the engine which animation and frame the effect rides on (meta.beanfx.caster).

The sprites are the owner's licensed art and stay local: `casters/<name>/` in the project (gitignored), never
in the plugin. A later character that keeps the same rig.json (frame size, pivot, animations, frame counts,
contact frames, directions) works with every effect drawn on the first one.

casters/<name>/rig.json:
    {"name": "knight_side", "view": "side", "facing": "east", "fps": 10,
     "anims": {"attack1": {"frame": [96, 80], "frames": 8, "sheet": "attack01.png", "pivot": [50, 64],
                           "contact": [1, 5]}}}
    top-down: "view": "top-down", "directions": ["east", "south", "west", "north"] (or the 8 of facing.NAMES8),
    and each animation gives "sheets": {"east": "attack1_right.png", ...} in place of "sheet".
    side with its own west row (an asymmetric character, such as a sword in the right hand): "view": "side",
    "directions": ["east", "west"] and "sheets" by direction; the engine then picks the row and never mirrors.
Each animation may carry its own "fps" (a game row's rate), else the rig's "fps" holds.
Optional: "pixel_scale" (sheet pixels per art pixel, 1 for native art), "height" (the character's height in art
pixels), and per animation "swing": the sword strokes as [{"kind": "slash", "turn": "cw" | "ccw", "from": deg,
"to": deg, "sweep": deg, "frames": [...]}] in screen degrees (0 east, 90 south, y down), on top-down a dict of
those lists by direction. An effect's slash follows the stroke: same turn, from and to. "root" (with "move":
"root"): the body's travel per frame as [dx, dy] px from where the animation starts (a dict by direction on
top-down), for animations whose frames stay in place while the character moves, such as a dash; the engine moves
the character by it, and an effect on such an animation stays where the move began (place(travel=True) previews
that).
Also optional per animation, read by the engine and the effect author (rig.py passes them through untouched):
"thrust": [{"kind": "thrust", "frames": [...], "from": [dx, dy], "to": [dx, dy], "angle": deg}] the blade point
travelling from and to (px from the pivot) for a stab; "emit": {"frames": [...], "point": [dx, dy]} (a dict of
points by direction on top-down) where a cast art leaves the body; "hit": [frame] the frame a blow lands on a
hurt animation.
A missing pivot is measured from the sheet (`measure`): the centre of the feet in frame 0, on the lowest row any
frame reaches.
